# predictive-maintenance

## Overview
* Machine Learning Project for Data Science course @unibz. 
* Highly imbalanced synthetic dataset on predictive maintenance. 
* Features: Physical forces applied on the machines. 
* 2 Targets: 
  1) Does the machine fail or not? Binary Classification Problem. 
  2) Which failure type happened? Multiple Classification Problem. 
* Classifiers used and compared in the project: 
  + Decision Tree Classifier
  + Random Forest Classifier 
  + Different Naive Bayes Classifiers 
  + K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier 
* Performance of the Classifiers:
